Board: STM32F407G-DISC1                                                             
  IDE: STMCubeIDE                                                                              
Each 1-second, duty cycle is  increased by 10%.After reaching 100%, it starts up from zero again                                             
Timer3 interrupt routine is used to provide the time lapse of changes in the LED state and increase the duty cycle dynamically.
